I am a PhD candidate in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge. My doctoral research investigates tone and tone sandhi in the Xiangshan variety of Northern Wu Chinese, combining detailed phonetic documentation with quantitative methods such as machine-learning–based clustering, and presented a diachronically-based theoretical model of tone sandhi in Xiangshan and other Northern Wu varieties. 

My broader research interests include:

- Tone and tone sandhi
- Prosodic phonology and intonation
- Chinese dialectology, especially Wu varieties
- Diachronic phonology and language variation
- Quantitative and computational approaches in phonological research  



I first encountered linguistics in my undergraduate studies at City University of Hong Kong, and quickly realised it was something I wanted to pursue long term. After completing my Bachelor’s degree there, I continued my training with a Master’s degree at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, where I deepened my interest in Chinese phonology and dialectology.

I later moved to the University of Cambridge for postgraduate study, first completing an MPhil and then continuing into a PhD in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics. At Cambridge, my work has focused on documenting and analysing the tone and tone sandhi system of Xiangshan Northern Wu Chinese. 

Across my work, I am particularly motivated by how surface tonal alternations reflect deeper prosodic organisation and longer-term historical trajectories, and by how methodological tools can help us better capture the complexity of suprasegmental features.

Outside academic work, I enjoy journaling and keeping small, calming records of everyday life — habits that help me maintain balance and perspective alongside research.
